Hello ! I am a third-year PhD candidate in Machine Learning at [Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/) (CMAP) at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), advised by [Alain Durmus](https://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). Prior to this, I graduated with a MSc. degree in Applied Mathematics from École Polytechnique ("[Cycle Ingénieur](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien)") and a MRes. degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning ("[MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)") from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

**Current status**. Since mid-March 2025, I have been interning at [Jasper AI](https://www.jasper.ai/), in the French research team, to work on speeding up the inference of diffusion models for large-scale image restoration tasks. I will be returning to my PhD in mid-September 2025.

**Research interests**. I am interested in the study of problems at the intersection of generative modelling, sampling, dynamic optimal transport and stochastic optimal control (with a special focus on the **Schrödinger Bridge** problem and **score-based diffusion models**). 

**Environmental awareness**. Similarly to many researchers in machine learning, I feel concerned by the environmental impact of our research field, especially about the unsustainable circumstances of centralized worldwide conferences (which are getting bigger and bigger). This has motivated me to join the Neurips@Paris initiative. Feel free to reach me out about this topic !
