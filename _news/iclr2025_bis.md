My reflexion paper [Improving the evaluation of samplers on multi-modal targets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08916) co-authored with Louis Grenioux and Marylou Gabri√© has been accepted at the workshop [Frontiers in Probabilistic Inference : Learning meets Sampling](https://sites.google.com/view/fpiworkshop/) at ICLR 205 ! I am very excited to attend to this event (probably, the workshop most closely aligned with the content of my PhD !) : see you in Singapore in late April !
